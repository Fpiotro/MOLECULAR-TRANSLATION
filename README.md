This repository presents the solution developed during the **[BMS-Molecular-Translation competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bms-molecular-translation)**.
This one is composed of three parts:
* AutoEncoder
* EncoderDecoder
* Detector

These three parts were assembled in the final submission to provide an innovative and original solution üëç

## Objectives:
* Automated recognition of optical chemical structures 
* Convert images back to the underlying chemical structure (InChI text) 
* Help chemists expand access to collective chemical research
