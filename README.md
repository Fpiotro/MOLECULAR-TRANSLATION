This repository presents the solution developed during the **[BMS-Molecular-Translation competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bms-molecular-translation)**.
This one is composed of three parts:
* AutoEncoder
* EncoderDecoder
* Detector

These three parts were assembled in the final submission to provide an innovative and original solution üëç

## Objectives:
* Automated recognition of optical chemical structures 
* Convert images back to the underlying chemical structure (InChI text) 
* Help chemists expand access to collective chemical research

## Evaluation

"The [Levenshtein distance](https://medium.com/@ethannam/understanding-the-levenshtein-distance-equation-for-beginners-c4285a5604f0) is a distance, in the mathematical sense of the term, giving a measure of the difference between two strings of characters. It is equal to the minimum number of characters that must be deleted, inserted or replaced to go from one string to the other".
